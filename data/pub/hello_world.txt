Hello, world!

I am a file required for the IW4M extension DLL!

If you find me, you've likely been snooping in places you don't belong.

Please be aware that IW4Mx is only to be used on fourdeltaone.net servers,
or any official successor project declared by NTAuthority.

You will receive a complete counter-attack towards various exploitable
bugs in the extension DLL if you do not heed this warning.

Thanks, and have fun!
